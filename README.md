# ElasticEmailClient C#
This is simply a place for me to show the changes that Elastic Email makes to their publicly available ElasticEmailClient.cs

I will update the changes here not as often as they are made. I will make them at my leisure.

The original C# file is located here: http://api.elasticemail.com/public/client/cs

It is linked from the Elastic Email API support page: http://elasticemail.com/support/http-api/integration-libraries

API Documentation is here: http://api.elasticemail.com/public/help

Note: I am not officially affiliated with Elastic Email.
